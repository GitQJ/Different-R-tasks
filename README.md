## Simulation

In this report, we are helping a fuel company to give advice on the quality assurance strategy testing the fuel quality of each outlet. Fuel samples are collected from each stations and placed in trays that are placed in a conveyer for an automated testing process. The tray is passed in length through the machine that test the sample using a needle. This needle is aligned at the beginning of testing process but is subject to deviations after each test, which may result in test being inaccurate or machine becoming damaged, stopping the process and causing costly repairs. Engineers from the company were able to provide distributions and descriptives statistics for the deviations after observing the process. 

We are tasked with analysing the distribution of needle alignments at the end of the day, through simulation. We will provide a scatterplot to visualise it and calculate the likelihood of the machine becoming innacurate or failing at any point during the day and define the distribution of the number of test that can be completed before machine become innacurate or misaligned.

After that, we are provided costing information for the quality testing process. We will conduct a simulation to find the best strategy for testing. We will find the optimal number of test to maximise profits and give the expected net profit for this optimal number.

Finally, we will give a summary and recommendations on our findings.
